<h3><a name="THE_BATTLE_OF_OTTERBOURNE_Percy" id="THE_BATTLE_OF_OTTERBOURNE_Percy"></a>THE BATTLE OF OTTERBOURNE.</h3>


<p>In the twelfth year of Richard II. (1388,) the Scots assembled an
extensive army, with the intention of invading England on a grand scale,
in revenge for a previous incursion made by that sovereign. But
information having been received that the Northumbrians were gathering
in considerable force for a counter-invasion, it was thought prudent not
to attempt to carry out the original enterprise. While, therefore, the
main body of the army, commanded by the Earl of Fife, the Scottish
king's second son, ravaged the western borders of England, a detachment
of three or four thousand chosen men, under the Earl of Douglas,
penetrated by a swift march into the Bishopric of Durham, and laid waste
the country with fire and sword. Returning in triumph from this inroad,
Douglas passed insultingly before the gates of Newcastle, where Sir
Harry Percy lay in garrison. This fiery warrior, though he could not
venture to cope with forces far superior to his own, sallied out to
break a lance with his hereditary foe. In a skirmish before the town he
lost his spear and pennon, which Douglas swore he would plant as a
trophy on the highest tower of his castle, unless it should be that very
night retaken by the owner. Hotspur was deterred from<!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> accepting this
challenge immediately, by the apprehension that Douglas would be able to
effect a union with the main body of the Scottish army before he could
be overtaken, but when he learned, the second day, that the Earl was
retreating with ostentatious slowness, he hastily got together a company
of eight or ten thousand men, and set forth in pursuit.</p>

<p>The English forces, under the command of Hotspur and his brother, Sir
Ralph Percy, came up with the Scots at Otterbourne, a small village
about thirty miles from Newcastle, on the evening of the 15th of August.
Their numbers were more than double the Scots, but they were fatigued
with a long march. Percy fell at once on the camp of Douglas, and a
desperate action ensued. The victory seemed to be inclining to the
English, when the Scottish leader, as the last means of reanimating his
followers, rushed on the advancing enemy with heroic daring, and cleared
a way with his battle-axe into the middle of their ranks. All but alone
and unsupported, Douglas was overpowered by numbers, and sunk beneath
three mortal wounds. The Scots, encouraged by the furious charge of
their chieftain, and ignorant of his fate, renewed the struggle with
vigor. Ralph Percy was made prisoner by the Earl Mareschal, and soon
after Hotspur himself by Lord Montgomery. Many other Englishmen of rank
had the same fate. After a long fight, maintained with extraordinary
bravery on both sides, the English retired and left the Scots masters of
the field. (See Sir W. Scott's <i>History of Scotland</i>, i. 225.)</p>

<p>The ballad which follows, printed from the fourth or revised edition of
Percy's <i>Reliques</i> (vol. i. p. 21), was derived from a manuscript in the
Cotton library<!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> (Cleopatra, c. iv. fol. 64), thought to be written about
the middle of the sixteenth century. In the earlier editions, a less
perfect copy, from the Harleian collection, had been used. Hume of
Godscroft, speaking of the songs made on the battle of Otterbourne,
says, "the Scots song made of Otterbourne telleth the time&mdash;about
Lammas; and also the occasion&mdash;to take preys out of England; also the
dividing armies betwixt the Earls of Fife and Douglas, and their several
journeys, almost as in the authentic history," and proceeds to quote the
first stanza of the present ballad. Again, it is said that at Lammas,
when the Scotch husbandmen are busy at getting in their hay, the season
has been over for a month in most parts of England. From these
circumstances, and the occurrence of certain Scottish words, the first
part of <i>The Battle of Otterbourne</i> has been regarded as a Scottish
composition, retouched by an English hand.</p>

<p>A somewhat mutilated version of this ballad was published in Herd's
<i>Scottish Songs</i>. This, though defective, well deserves <a href="#THE_BATTLE_OF_OTTERBURN_See_p_5">a place in our
Appendix</a>. Sir Walter Scott inserted in the <i>Minstrelsy</i> another edition
made up by him from two copies obtained from the recitation of old
persons residing in Ettrick Forest, and it is <a href="#THE_BATTLE_OF_OTTERBOURNE_Scott">here subjoined</a> to Percy's
version.</p>

<p>Genealogical notices of the personages mentioned in this and the
following ballad will be found in Percy's <i>Reliques</i> and in Scott's
<i>Minstrelsy</i>.</p>

Carlisle.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Percy.</span></p>

stations here mentioned are well-known places in Northumberland.
Ottercap-hill is in the parish of Kirk-Whelpington, in Tynedale-ward.
Rodeliffe&mdash;(or, as it is more usually pronounced, Rodeley&mdash;) Cragge is a
noted cliff near Rodeley, a small village in the parish of Hartburn, in
Morpeth-ward. Green Leyton is another small village in the same parish
of Hartburn, and is southeast of Rodeley. Both the original MSS. read
here, corruptly, Hoppertop and Lynton.&mdash;P.</p>

retain this reading, because stagge signifies in Scotland a young
stallion, and by supplying "off" the line would make sense. It was one
of the Border laws, he remarks, that the Scottish array of battle should
be on foot (<a href="#LNanchor_4a2_15">see v. 15 of the Second Part</a>). Horses were used but for a
retreat or pursuit.</p>

earldom of Menteith was possessed by Robert Earl of Fife, who was in
command of the main body of the army, and consequently not with
Douglas.</p>

<p><a name="Linenote_4a_103" id="Linenote_4a_103"></a><a href="#LNanchor_4a_103" title="link to line number">103</a>. The reference is to Sir John Gordon. The use of this
designation shows, says Percy, that the ballad was not composed before
1449. In that year the title of Earl of Huntly was first conferred on
Alexander Seaton, who married the grand-daughter of the Gordon of
Otterbourne.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_HUNTING_OF_THE_CHEVIOT" id="THE_HUNTING_OF_THE_CHEVIOT"></a>THE HUNTING OF THE CHEVIOT.</h3>


<p>In <i>the Battle of Otterbourne</i> the story is told with all the usual
accuracy of tradition, and the usual fairness of partizans. Not so with
the following ballad, which is founded on the same event. "That which is
commonly sung of the <i>Hunting of Cheviot</i>," says Hume of Godscroft
truly, "seemeth indeed poetical, and a <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>mere fiction, perhaps to stir up
virtue; yet a fiction whereof there is no mention either in the Scottish
or English chronicle." When this ballad arose we do not know, but we may
suppose that a considerable time would elapse before a minstrel would
venture to treat an historical event with so much freedom.</p>

<p>We must, however, allow some force to these remarks of Percy: "With
regard to the subject of this ballad, although it has no countenance
from history, there is room to think it had originally some foundation
in fact. It was one of the laws of the Marches, frequently renewed
between the nations, that neither party should hunt in the other's
borders, without leave from the proprietors or their deputies. There had
long been a rivalship between the two martial families of Percy and
Douglas, which, heightened by the national quarrel, must have produced
frequent challenges and struggles for superiority, petty invasions of
their respective domains, and sharp contests for the point of honour;
which would not always be recorded in history. Something of this kind,
we may suppose, gave rise to the ancient ballad of the <i>Hunting a' the
Cheviat</i>. Percy Earl of Northumberland had vowed to hunt for three days
in the Scottish border, without condescending to ask leave from Earl
Douglas, who was either lord of the soil, or lord warden of the Marches.
Douglas would not fail to resent the insult, and endeavour to repel the
intruders by force: this would naturally produce a sharp conflict
between the two parties; something of which, it is probable, did really
happen, though not attended with the tragical circumstances recorded in
the ballad: for these are evidently borrowed from the Battle of
Otter<!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>bourn, a very different event, but which aftertimes would easily
confound with it."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The ballad as here printed is of the same age as the preceding. It is
extracted from Hearne's Preface to the <i>History</i> of Guilielmus
Neubrigensis, p. lxxxii. Hearne derived his copy from a manuscript in
the Ashmolean collection at Oxford, and printed the text in long lines,
which, according to custom, are now broken up into two.</p>

<p>The manuscript copy is subscribed at the end "Expliceth quoth Rychard
Sheale." Richard Sheale (it has been shown by a writer in the <i>British
Bibliographer</i>, vol. iv. p. 97-105) was a minstrel by profession, and
several other pieces in the same MS. have a like signature with this. On
this ground it has been very strangely concluded that Sheale was not, as
Percy and Ritson supposed, the transcriber, but the actual author of
this noble ballad. The glaring objection of the antiquity of the
language has<!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> been met, first, by the supposition that the author
belonged to the north of England, and afterwards, when it appeared that
Sheale lived at Tamworth, about a hundred miles from London, by the
allegation that the language of a person in humble life in Warwickshire
or Staffordshire would be very far behind the current speech of the
metropolis. It happens, however, that the language of the ballad is very
much older than the other compositions of Sheale, as a moment's
inspection will show. Besides, Sheale's poetical abilities were
manifestly of the lowest order, and although he styles himself
"minstrel," we have no reason to think that he ever composed ballads. He
speaks of his memory being at one time so decayed that he "could neither
sing nor talk." Being a mere ballad-<i>singer</i> and story-teller, he would
naturally be dependent on that faculty. The fact is very obvious, that
Richard Sheale was a mere reciter of songs and tales; at any rate, that
all we have to thank him for in the matter of <i>Chevy Chase</i> is for
committing to paper the only old copy that has come down to our
times.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Hunting of the Cheviot</i> is mentioned in the <i>Complaynt of Scotland</i>
with other, very ancient, ballads. It was consequently popular in
Scotland in 1548, ten years before the time that we <i>know</i> Sheale to
have written anything. The mention of James the Scottish King forbids us
to assign this piece an earlier date than the reign of Henry VI.</p>

<p>It has been customary to understand Sidney's<!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> saying of the "old song of
Percy and Douglas"&mdash;that it moved his heart more than a
trumpet&mdash;exclusively of <i>Chevy Chase</i>. There is no question which ballad
would stand higher in the estimation of the gentle knight, but the terms
by which the war-song he admired is described are of course equally
applicable to <i>The Battle of Otterbourne</i>. By the way we may remark that
if we do understand Sidney to have meant <i>Chevy Chase</i>, then, whatever
opinion writers of our day may have of its antiquity, and however
probable it may seem to them that <i>Chevy Chase</i> was written by a
contemporary of Sir Philip, it appeared to the author of the <i>Defence of
Poetry</i> to be "evil apparelled in the dust and cobweb of an uncivil
age"!</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The Editor of the <i>Reliques</i> afterwards met with the following
passage in Collins's <i>Peerage</i>, which he thought might throw some light
on the question of the origin of the ballad.</p>

<p>"In this ... year, 1436, according to Hector Boethius, was fought the
battle of Pepperden, not far from the Cheviot Hills, between the Earl of
Northumberland [IId Earl, son of Hotspur], and Earl William Douglas, of
Angus, with a small army of about four thousand men each, in which the
latter had the advantage. As this seems to have been a private conflict
between these two great Chieftains of the Borders, rather than a
national war, it has been thought to have given rise to the celebrated
old ballad of Chevy-Chase; which to render it more pathetic and

<h3><a name="CHEVY-CHACE" id="CHEVY-CHACE"></a>CHEVY-CHACE.</h3>


<p>The text of this later ballad of <i>Chevy-Chace</i> is given as it appears in
<i>Old Ballads</i> (1723), vol. i. p. 111, and in Durfey's <i>Pills to Purge
Melancholy</i>, vol. iv. p. 289, and differs very slightly from that of the
<i>Reliques</i> (i. 265), where the ballad was printed from the folio MS.,
compared with two other black-letter copies.</p>

<p>The age of this version of the story is not known, but it is certainly
not later, says Dr. Rimbault, than the reign of Charles the Second.
Addison's papers in the <i>Spectator</i> (Nos. 70 and 74) evince so true a
perception of the merits of this ballad, shorn as it is of the most
striking beauties of the grand original, that we cannot but deeply
regret his never having seen the ancient and genuine copy, which was
published by Hearne only a few days after Addison died. Well might the
Spectator dissent from the judgment of Sidney, if <i>this</i> were the rude
and ill-apparelled song of a barbarous age.</p>

<h3><a name="SIR_ANDREW_BARTON" id="SIR_ANDREW_BARTON"></a>SIR ANDREW BARTON.</h3>

<p class="center">From Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, ii. 193.</p>


<p>"The transactions which did the greatest honour to the Earl of Surrey
and his family at this time [<span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1511], was their behaviour in the
case of Barton, a Scotch sea-officer. This gentleman's father having
suffered by sea from the Portuguese, he had obtained letters of marque
for his two sons to make reprisals upon the subjects of Portugal. It is
extremely probable, that the court of Scotland granted these letters
with no very honest intention. The council-board of England, at which
the Earl of Surrey held the chief place, was daily pestered with
complaints from the sailors and merchants, that Barton, who was called
Sir Andrew Barton, under pretence of searching for Portuguese goods,
interrupted the English navigation. Henry's situation at that time
rendered him backward from breaking with Scotland, so that their
complaints were but coldly received. The Earl of Surrey, however, could
not smother his indignation, but gallantly declared at the
council-board, that while he had an estate that could furnish out a
ship, or a son that was capable of commanding one, the narrow seas
should not be infested.</p>

<p>"Sir Andrew Barton, who commanded the two Scotch ships, had the
reputation of being one of the ablest sea officers of his time. By his
depredations,<!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> he had amassed great wealth, and his ships were very
richly laden. Henry, notwithstanding his situation, could not refuse the
generous offer made by the Earl of Surrey. Two ships were immediately
fitted out, and put to sea with letters of marque, under his two sons,
Sir Thomas and Sir Edward Howard. After encountering a great deal of
foul weather, Sir Thomas came up with the Lion, which was commanded by
Sir Andrew Barton in person; and Sir Edward came up with the Union,
Barton's other ship [called by Hall, the Bark of Scotland]. The
engagement which ensued was extremely obstinate on both sides; but at
last the fortune of the Howards prevailed. Sir Andrew was killed,
fighting bravely, and encouraging his men with his whistle, to hold out
to the last; and the two Scotch ships, with their crews, were carried
into the River Thames [Aug. 2, 1511]." (Guthrie's <i>Peerage</i>, as quoted
by Percy.)</p>

<p>An old copy in the precious Manuscript furnished the foundation for
Percy's edition of this noble ballad. The editor states that the text of
the original was so incorrect as to require emendations from
black-letter copies and from conjecture. These emendations, where they
are noted, we have for the most part disregarded. We would fain believe
that nothing except a defect in the manuscript could have reconciled the
Bishop to adopting the four lines with which the ballad now begins.</p>

<p>The common, or black-letter copies, are somewhat abridged as well as
modernized. One of these is given <a href="#A_TRUE_RELATION_OE_THE_LIFE_AND_DEATH_OF_SIR_ANDREW_BARTON_A_PYRATE_AND">in the Appendix</a>.<!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">From Ritson's <i>Ancient Songs</i>, ii. 70.</p>


<p>"The battle of Flodden, in Northumberland, was fought the 9th of
September, 1513, being the fifth year of King Henry the Eighth (who,
with a great army, was then before Terouen in France), between Thomas
Howard, Earl of Surrey, commander-in-chief of the English forces, and
James the Fourth, King of Scots, with an inferior army of 15,000 men,
who were entirely routed with great slaughter, their heroic sovereign
being left dead upon the field.</p>

<p>"The following ballad may possibly be as ancient as any thing we have on
the subject. It is given from <i>The most pleasant and delectible history
of John Winchcomb, otherwise called Jack of Newberry</i>, written by Thomas
Deloney, who thus speaks of it: 'In disgrace of the Scots, and in
remembrance of the famous atchieved victory, the commons of England made
this song, which to this day is not forgotten of many.'"</p>

<p>This ballad is very evidently not the work of Deloney, but derived by
him from tradition.</p>

<p>There is a piece called <i>Flodden Field</i> in Herd's <i>Scottish Songs</i>, i.
86. It is made up of certain ridiculous anonymous verses, and of the
stanzas written by Miss Jane Elliot and by Mrs. Cockburn to the old air
<i>The Flowers of the Forest</i>,&mdash;"I've heard them lilting," and "I've seen
the smiling." The first and last lines of the first stanza of Miss
Elliot's verses are from an ancient and now forgotten song.<!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="QUEEN_JEANIE" id="QUEEN_JEANIE"></a>QUEEN JEANIE.</h3>


<p>Jane Seymour, queen of Henry VIII., died shortly after giving birth to
Prince Edward (Oct. 1537). There was a report that the Cæsarian
operation had been necessary to effect the delivery, and on this story
the present ballad is founded.</p>

<p>There is a woful ditty on this subject in <i>The Crown Garland of Golden
Roses</i>, Percy Society, vol. vi. p. 29 (or <i>Collection of Old Ballads</i>,

taken from Kinloch's <i>Ancient Scottish Ballads</i>, p. 116. A fragment had
been previously published in Jamieson's <i>Popular Ballads</i>, i. 182. We

<h3><a name="THE_MURDER_OF_THE_KING_OF_SCOTS" id="THE_MURDER_OF_THE_KING_OF_SCOTS"></a>THE MURDER OF THE KING OF SCOTS.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</i>, ii. 210.</p>


<p>"The catastrophe of Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, the unfortunate husband
of Mary Queen of Scots, is the subject of this ballad. It is here
related in that partial imperfect manner, in which such an event would
naturally strike the subjects of another kingdom, of which he was a
native. Henry appears to have been a vain, capricious, worthless young
man,<!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> of weak understanding, and dissolute morals. But the beauty of his
person, and the inexperience of his youth, would dispose mankind to
treat him with an indulgence, which the cruelty of his murder would
afterwards convert into the most tender pity and regret: and then
imagination would not fail to adorn his memory with all those virtues he
ought to have possessed.</p>

<p>"Darnley, who had been born and educated in England, was but in his 21st
year when he was murdered, Feb. 9, 1567-8. This crime was perpetrated by
the Earl of Bothwell, not out of respect to the memory of Riccio, but in
order to pave the way for his own marriage with the queen.</p>

<p>"This ballad (printed, with a few corrections, from the Editor's folio
MS.) seems to have been written soon after Mary's escape into England in
1568, see v. 65.&mdash;It will be remembered, at v. 5, that this princess was
Queen Dowager of France, having been first married to Francis II., who
died Dec. 4, 1560."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Percy.</span></p>

<h3><a name="THE_RISING_IN_THE_NORTH" id="THE_RISING_IN_THE_NORTH"></a>THE RISING IN THE NORTH.</h3>

<p class="center">Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, i. 285.</p>


<p>The subject of this ballad is the insurrection of the Earls of
Northumberland and Westmoreland, in the twelfth year of Queen Elizabeth,
1569.</p>

<p>These two noblemen were the leaders of the Catholic party in the North
of England, and interested themselves warmly in various projects to
restore Mary<!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> Stuart to her liberty. When a marriage was proposed
between the Duke of Norfolk and the Scottish Queen, they, with many of
the first persons in the kingdom, entered zealously into the scheme,
having the ulterior view, according to Hume, of placing Mary on the
throne of England. Norfolk endeavored to conceal his plans from
Elizabeth, until he should form a combination powerful enough to extort
her consent, but the Queen received information betimes, and committed
the Duke to the Tower. Several of his abettors were also taken into
custody, and the two Northern Earls were summoned to appear at court, to
answer to the charge of an intended rebellion. They had proceeded too
far to trust themselves willingly in the hands of their enraged
sovereign, and the summons precipitated them into an insurrection for
which they were not prepared. They hastily gathered their followers, and
published a manifesto, in which they declared that they maintained an
unshaken allegiance to the Queen, and sought only to reëstablish the
religion of their ancestors, and to restore the Duke of Norfolk to
liberty and to the Queen's favor.</p>

<p>"Their common banner (on which was displayed the cross, together with
the five wounds of Christ,) was borne by an ancient gentleman, Richard
Norton, Esq., of Norton-Conyers: who with his sons (among whom,
Christopher, Marmaduke, and Thomas, are expressly named by Camden)
distinguished himself on this occasion. Having entered Durham, they tore
the Bible, &amp;c., and caused mass to be said there: they then marched on to
Clifford Moor near Wetherbye, where they mustered their men. Their
intention was to have proceeded on to York; but, altering their<!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> minds,
they fell upon Barnard's castle, which Sir George Bowes held out against
them for eleven days."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Percy.</span></p>

<p>The insurgents' army amounted to about six thousand men. The Earl of
Sussex, supported by Lord Hunsdon and others, marched against them with
seven thousand, and the Earl of Warwick with still greater forces.
Before these superior numbers the rebels dispersed without striking a
blow. Northumberland fled to the Scots, by whom, as we shall see in the
next ballad, he was betrayed to Elizabeth. The Earl of Westmoreland
escaped to Flanders, and died there in penury.</p>

<p>Another outbreak following close upon the above was suppressed by Lord
Hunsdon. Great cruelties were exercised by the victorious party, no less
than eight hundred having, it is said, suffered by the hands of the
executioner.</p>

<p>The ballad was printed by Percy from two MS. copies, one of them in the
editor's folio collection. "They contained considerable variations, out
of which such readings were chosen as seemed most poetical and consonant
to history."</p>

<p>"The Fate of the Nortons," we need hardly say, forms the subject of
Wordsworth's <i>White Doe of Rylstone</i>.</p>

Richard Norton, the father, and <i>seven</i> sons, and in "a list of the
rebels in the late Northern rebellion that are fled beyond seas," the
same seven sons are named. Richard Norton, the father, was living long
after the rebellion in Spanish Flanders. See Sharp's <i>Bishoprick

were two bulls argent, ducally collar'd gold, armed or, &amp;c. But I have
not discovered the device mentioned in the ballad, among the badges,
&amp;c., given by that house. This however is certain, that, among those of
the Nevilles, Lord Abergavenny (who were of the same family), is a dun
cow with a golden collar; and the Nevilles of Chyte in Yorkshire (of the
Westmoreland branch), gave for their crest, in 1513, a dog's
(greyhound's) head erased.&mdash;So that it is not improbable but Charles
Neville, the unhappy Earl of Westmoreland here mentioned, might on this
occasion give the above device on his banner.&mdash;After all, our old
minstrel's verses here may have undergone some corruption; for, in
another ballad in the same folio MS., and apparently written by the same
hand, containing the sequel of this Lord Westmoreland's history, his
banner is thus described, more conformable to his known bearings:</p>

<h3><a name="NORTHUMBERLAND_BETRAYED_BY_DOUGLAS" id="NORTHUMBERLAND_BETRAYED_BY_DOUGLAS"></a>NORTHUMBERLAND BETRAYED BY DOUGLAS.</h3>

<p class="center">Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, i. 295.</p>


<p>The Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland, after the dispersion of
their forces took refuge with the Scots on the Borders. The Elliots
drove them from Liddesdale, and they sought the protection of the
Armstrongs in the Debatable Land. Northumberland took up his residence
with a man of that tribe called Hector of Harlaw, relying on his
plighted faith and on his gratitude for many past favors. By this
miscreant the Earl was betrayed for money to the Regent Murray. He was
confined in Lochleven Castle until 1572, when he was handed over to Lord
Hunsden, and executed at York.</p>

<p>We are assured that this Hector, who had been rich, fell into poverty
after his treachery, and became so infamous that "to take Hector's
cloak" was a proverb for a man who betrayed his friend.</p>

<p>In Pinkerton's <i>Poems from the Maitland MS</i>. (pp. 219-234) are three
bitter invectives on this subject. In one of these we are told that the
traitor Eckie of Harlaw said he sold the Earl "to redeem his pledge,"
that is, says Scott, the pledge which had been exacted from him for his
peaceable demeanor.</p>

<p>"The interposal of the Witch-Lady (v. 53)" hath some countenance from
history; for, about twenty-five<!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> years before, the Lady Jane Douglas,
Lady Glamis, sister of the Earl of Angus, and nearly related to Douglas
of Lough-leven, had suffered death for the pretended crime of
witchcraft; who, it is presumed, is the witch-lady alluded to in <a href="#Line_11_133">verse
133</a>.</p>

<p>"The following is selected (like the former) from two copies, which
contained great variations; one of them in the Editor's folio MS. In the
other copy some of the stanzas at the beginning of this ballad are
nearly the same with what in that MS. are made to begin another ballad
on the escape of the Earl of Westmoreland, who got safe into Flanders,
and is feigned in the ballad to have undergone a great variety of
adventures."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Percy.</span></p>

<h3><a name="KING_OF_SCOTS_AND_ANDREW_BROWNE" id="KING_OF_SCOTS_AND_ANDREW_BROWNE"></a>KING OF SCOTS AND ANDREW BROWNE.</h3>

<p class="center">From <i>Reliques of English Poetry</i>, ii. 217.</p>


<p>"This ballad is a proof of the little intercourse that subsisted between
the Scots and English, before the accession of James I. to the crown of
England. The tale which is here so circumstantially related, does not
appear to have had the least foundation in history, but was probably
built upon some confused hearsay report of the tumults in Scotland
during the minority of that prince, and of the conspiracies formed by
different factions to get possession of his person. It should seem from
ver. 97 to have been written during the regency, or at least before the
death, of the Earl of Morton, who was condemned and executed June 2,
1581; when James was in his fifteenth year.</p>

<p>"The original copy (preserved in the archives of<!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> the Antiquarian
Society, London,) is entitled, <i>A new ballad, declaring the great
treason conspired against the young king of Scots, and how one Andrew
Browne, an English-man, which was the king's chamberlaine, prevented the
same. To the tune of Milfield, or els to Green-sleeves</i>. At the end is
subjoined the name of the author, W. Elderton. 'Imprinted at London for
Yarathe James, dwelling in Newgate Market, over against Ch. Church,' in
black-letter folio."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Percy.</span></p>

<p>This ballad was licensed to James on the 30th of May, 1581.</p>

<p>"In the year 1584, the Spaniards, under the command of Alexander
Farnese, Prince of Parma, began to gain great advantages in Flanders and
Brabant, by recovering many strongholds and cities from the<!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> Hollanders,
as Ghent (called then by the English Gaunt), Antwerp, Mechlin, &amp;c. See
Stow's <i>Annals</i>, p. 711. Some attempt made with the assistance of
English volunteers to retrieve the former of those places, probably gave
occasion to this ballad. I can find no mention of our heroine in
history, but the following rhymes rendered her famous among our poets.
Ben Jonson often mentions her, and calls any remarkable virago by her
name. See his <i>Epic[oe]ne</i>, first acted in 1609, Act 4, sc. 2: his <i>Tale
of a Tub</i>, Act 4, sc. 4: and his masque entitled <i>The Fortunate Isles</i>,
1626, where he quotes the very words of the ballad,</p>

<h3><a name="BRAVE_LORD_WILLOUGHBEY" id="BRAVE_LORD_WILLOUGHBEY"></a>BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBEY.</h3>

<p class="center">Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, ii. 235.</p>


<p>"Peregrine Bertie, Lord Willoughby of Eresby, had, in the year 1586,
distinguished himself at the siege of Zutphen, in the Low Countries. He
was the year after made general of the English forces in the United
Provinces, in room of the Earl of Leicester, who was recalled. This gave
him an opportunity of signalizing his courage and military skill in
several actions against the Spaniards. One of these, greatly exaggerated
by popular report, is probably the subject of this old ballad, which, on
account of its flattering encomiums on English valour, hath always been
a favourite with the people.</p>

<p>"Lord Willoughbie died in 1601.&mdash;Both Norris and Turner were famous
among the military men of that age.</p>

<p>"The subject of this ballad (which is printed from an old black-letter
copy, with some conjectural emendations) may possibly receive
illustration from what Chapman says in the dedication to his version of
Homer's <i>Frogs and Mice</i>, concerning the brave and<!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> memorable retreat of
Sir John Norris, with only 1000 men, through the whole Spanish army,
under the Duke of Parma, for three miles together." <span class="smcap">Percy.</span></p>

<p>Lord Willoughby was son of that Duchess of Suffolk, whose extraordinary
adventures, while in exile on the continent during the reign of Queen
Mary, are the subject of an often-printed ballad called the <a href="#THE_DUCHESS_OF_SUFFOLKS_CALAMITY"><i>Duchess of
Suffolk's Calamity</i></a>. See <i>Strange Histories</i>, Percy Society, iii. 17,
and the Appendix to this volume.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_BONNY_EARL_OF_MURRAY_Ramsay" id="THE_BONNY_EARL_OF_MURRAY_Ramsay"></a>THE BONNY EARL OF MURRAY.</h3>

<p class="center">From <i>The Tea-Table Miscellany</i>, ii. 188.</p>


<p>In consequence of a suspicion that the Earl of Murray had been party to
an attempt of his cousin, the notorious Bothwell, against the person of
the King (James VI.), a commission was issued for bringing Murray before
the sovereign for examination. The arrest was inconsiderately entrusted
to the Earl of Huntly, Murray's mortal enemy. The young earl was at that
time peacefully residing at Dunnibirsel, the house of his mother, Lady
Downe. Huntly surrounded the place and summoned the inmates to
surrender, and the demand not being complied with, set fire to the
mansion. Murray escaped from the flames, but was overtaken by his foes
and savagely slain. The event took place on the night of the 7th of
February, 1592.</p>

<p>The youth, beauty, and accomplishments of the victim of this outrage
made him a favourite with the people, and there was a universal clamor
for revenge. On the 10th of the month, proclamation was made for all
noblemen and barons, in a great number of shires, to rise in arms, to
join the King for the pursuit of the Earl of Huntly, who, however,
surrendered himself, and was dismissed, on security for his appearance
to answer for the crime. The moderation of James gave rise to a
scandalous report, that the king countenanced<!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> the murderer, out of
jealousy for the favor with which the bonny earl was regarded by the
Queen.</p>

<p>The ballad of <i>Young Waters</i> (vol. iii. p. 89) has, without convincing
reasons, been supposed to be founded on the story of the Earl of Murray.</p>

<p>The first of the two pieces which follow is from Ramsay's <i>Tea-Table
Miscellany</i>. <a href="#THE_BONNIE_EARL_O_MURRAY_Finlay">The second</a>, which may perhaps be a part of the same ballad,
was first printed in Finlay's collection.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_WINNING_OF_CALES" id="THE_WINNING_OF_CALES"></a>THE WINNING OF CALES.</h3>


<p>This is one of many exulting effusions which were called forth by the
taking of Cadiz (vulgarly called Cales). The town was captured on the
21st of June, 1596, the Earl of Effingham being high-admiral of the
fleet, and Essex general of the land forces. Sir W. Raleigh, Lord Thomas
Howard, and other distinguished soldiers had commands in the expedition.
The praise here bestowed on Essex's humanity was richly deserved, and
the booty taken by the conquerors is not exaggerated. The whole loss of
the Spaniards, in their city and their fleet, was estimated at twenty
millions of ducats.</p>

<p>We give this ballad from Deloney's <i>Garland of Good Will</i>, as reprinted
by the Percy Society, vol. xxx. p. 113. The copy in the <i>Reliques</i> (ii.
241), which was corrected by the editor, differs but slightly from the
present.</p>

<h3><a name="SIR_JOHN_SUCKLINGS_CAMPAIGN" id="SIR_JOHN_SUCKLINGS_CAMPAIGN"></a>SIR JOHN SUCKLING'S CAMPAIGN.</h3>


<p>"When the Scottish Covenanters rose up in arms, and advanced to the
English borders in 1639, many of the courtiers complimented the king by
raising forces at their own expense. Among these none were more
distinguished than the gallant Sir John Suck<!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>ling, who raised a troop of
horse, so richly accoutred, that it cost him 12,000<i>l.</i> The like
expensive equipment of other parts of the army made the king remark,
that "the Scots would fight stoutly, if it were but for the Englishmen's
fine cloaths." When they came to action, the rugged Scots proved more
than a match for the fine showy English: many of whom behaved remarkably
ill, and among the rest this splendid troop of Sir John Suckling's."
<span class="smcap">Percy.</span></p>

<p>This scoffing ballad, sometimes attributed to Suckling himself, is taken
from the <i>Musarum Deliciæ</i> of Sir John Mennis and Dr. James Smith (p. 81
of the reprint, <i>Upon Sir John Sucklings most warlike preparations for
the Scotish warre</i>). The former is said by Wood to have been the author.
Percy's copy (<i>Reliques</i>, ii. 341) has one or two different
readings.&mdash;The first stanza is a parody on <i>John Dory</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_BATTLE_OF_PHILIPHAUGH" id="THE_BATTLE_OF_PHILIPHAUGH"></a>THE BATTLE OF PHILIPHAUGH.</h3>

<p class="center">From <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, ii. 177.</p>


<p>By a rapid series of extraordinary victories, (see <a href="#THE_HAWS_OF_CROMDALE"><i>The Haws of
Cromdale</i></a>, and <a href="#THE_BATTLE_OF_ALFORD"><i>The Battle of Alford</i></a> in the Appendix,) Montrose had
subdued Scotland to the royal arms, from the Grampians to Edinburgh.
After taking possession of the capital, he marched forward to the
frontiers, with the intention of completing the subjugation of the
southern provinces, and even of leading his wild array into England to
the support of King Charles. Having traversed the Border, and
strengthened his army (greatly diminished by the departure of the Irish
and many of the Highlanders) with some small reinforcements, Montrose
encamped on the 12th of September, 1645, at Philiphaugh, a large plain,<!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
separated by the river Ettrick from the town of Selkirk, and extending
in an easterly direction from a wooded hill, called the Harehead-wood,
to a high ground which forms the banks of the river Tweed. Here the
infantry were very conveniently disposed, while the general took up his
quarters with all his cavalry at Selkirk, thus interposing a river
between his horse and foot. This extraordinary error, whether rashness
or oversight, was destined to be severely expiated. The very next
morning, the Covenanters, under General David Lesly, recalled from
England by the danger threatened their cause by the victories of
Montrose, crossed the Ettrick and fell on the encampment of the
infantry, unperceived by a single scout. A hopeless discomfiture was the
natural consequence. Montrose, roused by the firing, arrived with a few
of his cavalry too late to redeem the day, and beheld his army
slaughtered, or scattered in a retreat in which he was himself fain to
join. The fruit of all his victories was lost in this defeat, and he was
never again able to make head in Scotland against the Covenanters.</p>

<p>The following ballad was first printed by Sir Walter Scott, with
prefatory remarks which we have here abridged. It is preserved by
tradition in Selkirkshire, and coincides closely with historical fact.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_GALLANT_GRAHAMS" id="THE_GALLANT_GRAHAMS"></a>THE GALLANT GRAHAMS.</h3>

<p class="center">From <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, ii. 187</p>


<p>In this lament for the melancholy fate of Montrose and his heroic
companions, it was clearly the humble minstrel's aim to sketch the chief
incidents in the great Marquis's career as the champion and the martyr
of Royalty. The derangements and omissions which may be found in the
verses as they now stand are but the natural effects of time. The ballad
was first published in Scott's <i>Minstrelsy</i>, as obtained from tradition,
with enlargements and corrections from an old printed copy (entitled
<i>The Gallant Grahams of Scotland</i>) furnished by Ritson.</p>

<p>The summer following the rout at Philiphaugh, King Charles committed
himself to the treacherous protection of the Presbyterians. They
required of him that his faithful lieutenant should at once disband his
forces and leave the country. During three years of exile, Montrose
resided at various foreign courts, either quite inactive, or cultivating
the friendship of the continental sovereigns, by whom he was overwhelmed
with attentions and honors. The execution of the King drew from him a
solemn oath "before God, angels, and men," that he would devote the rest
of his life to the avenging the death of his master and reëstablishing
his son on the throne. He received from Charles II. a renewal of his
commission as Captain-General in Scotland, and while Charles was
treating with the Commissioners of the Estates concerning his
resto<!-- Page 138 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>ration (negotiations which Montrose regarded with no favor), set
out for the Orkneys with a few hundred men, mostly Germans. His coming,
even with this feeble band, struck a great terror into the Estates, and
Lesly was ordered to march against him with four thousand men. Destitute
of horse to bring him intelligence, Montrose was surprised at
Corbiesdale, on the confines of Ross-shire, by a body of Covenanting
cavalry under Colonel Strachan, which had been sent forward to check his
progress. The whole of his little army was destroyed or made prisoners.
Montrose escaped from the field after a desperate resistance, and
finally gave himself up to Macleod of Assaint, who sold him to his
enemies for four hundred bolls of meal!</p>

<p>"He was tried," says Scott, "for what was termed treason against the
Estates of the Kingdom; and, despite the commission of Charles for his
proceedings, he was condemned to die by a Parliament who acknowledged
Charles to be their king, and whom, on that account only, Montrose
acknowledged to be a Parliament."</p>

Endrick, in Dumbartonshire. S.</p>

(1639) the Covenanters began to wear a blue ribbon, first as a scarf,
afterwards in bunches in their caps. Hence the phrase of a true blue
Whig. The blue ribbon was one of "Montrose's whimsies," and seems to
have been retained by his followers (see v. <a href="#LNanchor_19_50" title="link to line number">50</a>) after he had left the
Covenanters for the king.</p>

the Covenanters, by whom he had been severely treated. S.</p>

<p><a name="Linenote_19_53" id="Linenote_19_53"></a><a href="#LNanchor_19_53" title="link to line number">53</a>. Newton, for obvious reasons, was a common appellation of
an estate, or barony, where a new edifice had been erected. Hence, for
distinction's sake, it was anciently compounded with the name of the
proprietor; as, Newton-Edmonstone, Newton-Don, Newton-Gordon, &amp;c. Of
Newtown, I only observe, that he was, like all his clan, a steady
loyalist, and a follower of Montrose. S.</p>

gentleman of great gallantry and accomplishments. He was a faithful

<h3><a name="THE_BATTLE_OF_LOUDON_HILL" id="THE_BATTLE_OF_LOUDON_HILL"></a>THE BATTLE OF LOUDON HILL.</h3>


<p>Graham of Claverhouse and Balfour of Kinloch, commonly called Burly, the
principal persons mentioned in this ballad, are characters well known to
the readers of <i>Old Mortality</i>, in the earlier chapters of which the
skirmish at Loudon Hill is described.</p>

<p>A few weeks after the memorable assassination of Archbishop Sharpe,
Robert Hamilton, a fierce Cameronian, Burly, and a few others of the
proscribed "Westlan' men" resolved to take up arms against the
government. They began their demonstrations by entering the royal burgh
of Rutherglen, on the 29th of May, 1679 (which, as the anniversary of
the Restoration, was appointed by Parliament to be kept as a holyday)
extinguishing the bonfires made in honor of the occasion, and burning at
the cross certain acts in favor of Prelacy and for the suppression of
Conventicles. After this exploit, and affixing to the cross a solemn
protest against the obnoxious acts, they encamped at Loudon Hill, being
by this time increased to the number of five or six hundred men.
Claver<!-- Page 145 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>house was in garrison at Glasgow, and immediately marched against
the insurgents, with about a hundred and fifty cavalry. Hamilton, the
commander of the Whigs, had skilfully posted his men in a boggy strait
with a broad ditch in front, and the dragoons in attempting to charge
were thrown into utter disorder. At this critical moment they were
vigorously attacked by the rebels and easily routed. Claverhouse barely
escaped being taken prisoner, and lost some twenty of his troopers,
among them his cornet, Robert Graham, whose fate is alluded to in the
ballad. Burly, though not the captain, was a prominent leader in this
action. See <span class="smcap">Scott</span>'s <i>Minstrelsy</i>, vol. ii. 206, <i>et seq.</i></p>

<h3><a name="THE_BATTLE_OE_BOTHWELL_BRIDGE" id="THE_BATTLE_OE_BOTHWELL_BRIDGE"></a>THE BATTLE OE BOTHWELL BRIDGE.</h3>

<p class="center">From <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, ii. 237.</p>


<p>The success of the Cameronians at Loudon Hill induced a considerable
number of the moderate Presbyterians to join the army of the insurgents.
But though increased numbers gave the revolt a more formidable
appearance, they cannot be said to have added much to the strength of
the rebels, since there was no concert between the two factions, each
having its own set of officers, and issuing contrary orders at the same
time. An army of ten thousand men under the Duke of Monmouth advanced
from Edinburgh against these distracted allies, who, in all not more
than four thousand, were encamped near Hamilton, on the western side of
the Clyde, and had possession of the bridge between that point and the
village of Bothwell. While the Duke was preparing to force a passage,
the more moderate of the Whigs offered terms, and while they were
debating the Duke's reply, the Cameronians, who bravely defended the
bridge, were compelled to abandon their<!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> post. The Duke's army then
crossed the river without opposition, because the rebels were at that
juncture occupied with cashiering their officers and electing new ones.
The first discharge of Monmouth's cannon caused the cavalry of the
Covenanters to wheel about, and their flight threw the foot into
irrecoverable disorder. Four hundred of the rebels were killed, and a
body of twelve hundred surrendered at discretion, and were preserved
from death by the clemency of the Duke. This action took place on the
22d of June, 1679.</p>

<p>Scott informs us that there were two Gordons of Earlstoun engaged in the
rebellion, a father and son. The former was not in the battle, but was
met hastening to it by English dragoons, and was killed on his refusing
to surrender. The son, who is supposed to be the person mentioned in the
ballad, was of the milder Presbyterians, and fought only for freedom of
conscience and relief from the tyrannical laws against non-conformists.
He escaped from the battle, and after being several times condemned to
die, was finally set at liberty, and restored to his forfeited estates.</p>

<p>In this ballad Claverhouse's unsparing pursuit of the fugitives is
imputed to a desire to revenge the death of his kinsman at Loudon Hill,
and his anger at being thwarted is, with great simplicity, asserted to
have led to the execution of Monmouth.</p>

<p>Scott's copy of this ballad was given from recitation. In the First
Series of Laing's <i>Fugitive Scottish Poetry</i>, there is an amusingly
prosaic Covenanting ditty upon this subject, called <i>Bothwell Lines</i>,
and in the Second Series, a Cavalier song, entitled The <i>Battell of
Bodwell Bridge, or The Kings Cavileers Triumph</i>.<!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="THE_BATTLE_OF_KILLIECRANKIE" id="THE_BATTLE_OF_KILLIECRANKIE"></a>THE BATTLE OF KILLIECRANKIE.</h3>


<p>This battle was fought on the evening of the 27th of July, 1689, a
little to the north of the pass of Killiecrankie, in the Highlands of
Perthshire, between King William's army under General Mackay, and a body
of Highlanders under the renowned Claverhouse,<!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> the bravest and most
faithful adherent of the house of Stuart. Mackay's troops, which were
partly Dutch and partly English, amounted to 4,500 foot and two
companies of horse. The Highlanders were not much more than half as
numerous. They consisted of the followers of Maclean, Macdonald of Sky,
Clanronald, Sir Evan Cameron of Lochiel, and others, with a few Irish.
The left wing of Mackay's army was almost instantly routed by a furious
charge of the Macleans. The right wing stood their ground manfully, and
even repulsed the assault of the Macdonalds, but being taken in flank by
the Camerons and a part of the Macleans, they were forced to retire and
suffered great loss. While directing the oblique movement of the
Camerons, Claverhouse received a mortal wound under the arm, and with
him fell the cause of King James.</p>

<p>This ballad, which is taken from Herd's <i>Scottish Songs</i>, i. 163, was
printed as a broadside near the time of the battle. The author is
unknown. There was an old song called <i>Killiecrankie</i>, which, with some
alterations, was inserted in Johnson's <i>Museum</i> (p. 302). It is also
found in Hogg's <i>Jacobite Relics</i>, i. 32, with an additional stanza. A
contemporary Latin ballad on the same event by Herbert Kennedy, a
professor in the University of Edinburgh, is given in the <i>Museum</i>, and
may be seen <a href="#PROELIUM_GILLICRANKIANUM_See_p_152">in our Appendix</a>.</p>

to resemble the English <i>her</i>, it has caused the Lowlanders to have a

gender. It has even become a sort of nickname for them, as in the

<h3><a name="THE_BATTLE_OF_SHERIFF-MUIR" id="THE_BATTLE_OF_SHERIFF-MUIR"></a>THE BATTLE OF SHERIFF-MUIR.</h3>


<p>Fought on the 13th of November, 1715, between the Duke of Argyle,
general of the forces of King George the First, and the Earl of Mar, for
the Chevalier de St. George. The right wing of both armies, led by the
respective commanders, was successful, and the left wing of both was
routed. Hence the victory was claimed by both sides. The Chevalier's
army was much the larger of the two, and all the advantages of the
contest remained with the other party.</p>

<p>This ballad is printed in Herd's <i>Scottish Songs</i>, i. 170, and in many
subsequent collections. It is ascribed by Burns to the "Rev. Murdoch
M'Lellan, minister of Crathie, Dee-side." Our copy is taken from Hogg's
<i>Jacobite Relics</i>, ii. 1, where the stanzas in brackets appear for the
first time. The notes are from Chambers's <i>Scottish Songs</i>, p. 408.</p>

<p>There are several other ballads upon this battle: <i>Up and war them a',
Willie</i>, Johnson's <i>Museum</i>, p. 195, and (different) Herd's <i>Scottish
Songs</i>, ii. 234: <i>From Bogie Side, or, The Marquis's Raide</i>, a false and
scurrilous party song, Hogg's <i>Jacobite Relics</i>, ii. 13: <!-- Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span><i>A Dialogue

John Barclay of Edinburgh, many years after the event: and <i>The Battle
of Sherramoor</i>, altered and abridged by Burns from this last, for
Johnson's <i>Museum</i>, (p. 290.) <a href="#A_DIALOGUE">See Appendix</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="LORD_DERWENTWATER" id="LORD_DERWENTWATER"></a>LORD DERWENTWATER.</h3>


<p>James Radcliff, Earl of Derwentwater, fell into the hands of the Whigs
at the surrender of Preston, on the very day of the battle of
Sheriff-Muir, and suffered death in February, 1716, for his
participation in the rebellion. Smollet has described him as an amiable
youth,&mdash;brave, open, generous, hospitable, and humane. "His fate drew
tears from the spectators, and was a great misfortune to the country in
which he lived. He gave bread to multitudes of people whom he employed
on his estate;&mdash;the poor, the widow, and the orphan rejoiced in his
bounty." (<i>History of England</i>, quoted by Cromek.) We are told that the
<i>aurora borealis</i> was remarkably vivid on the night of the earl's
execution, and that this phenomenon is consequently still known in the
north by the name of "Lord Derwentwater's Lights."</p>

<p>Although this ballad is said to have been extremely popular in the North
of England for a long time after the event which gave rise to it, no
good copy has as yet been recovered. The following was obtained by
Motherwell (<i>Minstrelsy</i>, p. 349) from the recitation of an old woman.
Another copy, also from recitation but "restored to poetical propriety,"
is given in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, for June, 1825 (p. 489), and<!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
fragments of a third in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, vol. xii. p. 492. Two
spurious ballads on the death of Lord Derwentwater have been sometimes
received as genuine: one by Allan Cunningham, first published in
Cromek's <i>Nithsdale and Galloway Song</i>, p. 129, another (<i>Lord
Derwentwater's Goodnight</i>) by Surtees, printed in Hogg's <i>Jacobite
Relics</i>, ii. 31. Still another modern imitation is <i>Young Ratcliffe</i>, in
Sheldon's <i>Minstrelsy of the English Border</i>, p. 401.</p>

<p>There is a ballad on the disgraceful capitulation of Preston in Hogg's

<p class="center">Herd's <i>Scottish Songs</i>, i. 166: Ritson's <i>Scotish Songs</i>, ii. 76.</p>


<p>This ballad is the work of Adam Skirving, a clever and opulent farmer,
father of Archibald Skirving, the portrait painter. It was printed
shortly after the battle as a broadside, and next appeared in <i>The
Charmer</i>, vol. ii. p. 349, Edinb. 1751. Neither of those editions
contains the eleventh stanza. The foot-notes commonly attached to the
subsequent re<!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>prints are found in <i>The Charmer</i>. (Laing in Johnson's
<i>Museum</i>, iv. 189*.)</p>

<p>To Skirving is also attributed with great probability the excellent
satirical song of <i>Johnnie Cope</i>, or <i>Cope are you waking yet</i>. The
original words are in Ritson, <i>Scotish Songs</i>, ii. 84: another set at p.
82: a third, with alterations and additions by Burns, in Johnson's
<i>Museum</i>, p. 242. Allan Cunningham once heard a peasant boast that he
could sing <i>Johnnie Cope</i> with all its <i>nineteen</i> variations. See
<a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>.</p>

<p>The battle took place on the 22d of September, 1745, between the
villages of Tranent and Prestonpans, a few miles from Edinburgh. The
king's lieutenant-general, Sir John Cope, was disgracefully defeated by
the Highlanders under Charles Edward, and nearly all his army killed or
taken. The details of the conflict are vividly described in the 46th and
47th chapters of Waverley.</p>

<p>In the versions of this ballad given in the body of this work, the Earl
of Douglas is represented as falling by the hand of Harry Percy. In the
ballad which follows, taken from Herd's <i>Scottish Songs</i>, i. 211, his
death is ascribed to the revenge of an offended servant. Though there is
not the slightest reason to give credence to this story, it has a
certain foundation in tradition. Hume of Godscroft writes "there are
that say, that he [Douglas] was not slain by the enemy, but by one of
his own men, a groom of his chamber, whom he had struck the day before
with a truncheon, in ordering of the battle, because he saw him make
somewhat slowly to. And they name this man John Bickerton of Luffness,
who left a part of his armour behind unfastened, and when he was in the
greatest conflict, this servant of his came behind his back, and slew
him thereat." Wintown says that the Earl was so intent on marshalling
his forces, and so eager to be at the foe, that he neglected to arm
himself carefully.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Scott</span>'s <i>Minstrelsy</i>, i. 350.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_BATTLE_OF_HARLAW" id="THE_BATTLE_OF_HARLAW"></a>THE BATTLE OF HARLAW.</h3>

<p class="center">From Ramsay's <i>Evergreen</i>, i. 78.</p>


<p>This battle took place at Harlaw, near Aberdeen, on the 24th of July,
1411. The conflict was occasioned by a dispute concerning the succession
to the earldom of Ross, between Donald, Lord of the Isles, and the son
of the Regent, Robert, Duke of Albany, whose claim was supported by
Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar. The consequences of this battle were of
the highest importance, inasmuch as the wild Celts of the Highlands and
Islands received such a check that they never again combined for the
conquest of the civilized parts of Scotland.</p>

<p>The <i>Battle of Harlaw</i> is one of the old ballads whose titles occur in
the <i>Complaynt of Scotland</i> (1548). A bag-pipe tune of that name is
mentioned in Drummond of Hawthornden's mock-heroic poem, the <i>Polemo
Middinia</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Interea ante alios dux Piper Laius heros,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Præcedens, magnamque gerens cum burdine pypam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Incipit Harlai cunctis sonare Batellum."<br /></span>
<!-- Page 181 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Mr. Laing, in his <i>Early Metrical Tales</i> (p. xlv.) speaks of an edition
printed in the year 1668 as being "in the curious library of old Robert
Myln." No copy is now known to exist of a date anterior to that which
was published in Ramsay's <i>Evergreen</i>. Of the age of this copy the most
opposite opinions have been maintained, some regarding the ballad as
contemporary with the event, and others insinuating that Ramsay, or one
of his friends, is chargeable with the authorship. This last notion has
no other ground than the freedom which Ramsay notoriously took with his
texts, and that freedom has very likely been exercised in the present
case. We shall, perhaps, be going quite as far as is prudent, if we
acknowledge that this may be one of "the Scots poems wrote by the
ingenious before 1600." Most readers will agree with Lord Hailes that
the language is as recent as the days of Queen Mary, or of James the
Sixth. Sibbald, in his <i>Chronicle of Scottish Poetry</i>, iii. 288, has
stated other objections to receiving this ballad for ancient, which
seem, however, to be satisfactorily answered by Finlay, <i>Scottish
Ballads</i>, i. 160.</p>

<p>The copy of this ballad in <i>The Thistle of Scotland</i>, p. 75, is only
Ramsay's, imperfectly remembered, or, what is quite as probable, here
and there altered according to the taste of the illiterate editor. At
page 92 of the same book, three stanzas are given of a burlesque song on
this battle. A traditional ballad, recently recovered, is inserted <a href="#THE_BATTLE_OF_HARLAW_See_p_180">at
the end of this volume</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="KING_HENRIE_THE_FIFTHS_CONQUEST" id="KING_HENRIE_THE_FIFTHS_CONQUEST"></a>KING HENRIE THE FIFTH'S CONQUEST.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Ancient Poems, Ballads, and Songs of the Peasantry of England.</i> Percy
Society, vol. xvii. p. 52.</p>


<p>"From the singing of the late Francis King, of Skipton in Craven, an
eccentric character, who was well known in the western dales of
Yorkshire as 'the Skipton Minstrel.' King's version does not contain the
third verse, which is obtained, as is also the title, from a modern
broadside, from whence also one or two verbal corrections are made, of
too trifling a nature to particularize. The tune to which King used to
sing it, is the same as that of <i>The Bold Pedlar and Robin Hood</i>."</p>

<p>Another ballad, much inferior in spirit to this, on the Battle of
Agincourt, is to be found in <i>The Crown Garland of Golden Roses</i> (ed.
1659), Percy Soc. vol.<!-- Page 191 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> xv. p. 65. Percy inserted in the <i>Reliques</i>, ii.
26, a song on this battle. Another, quoted in Heywood's <i>Edward Fourth</i>,
and therefore popular before 1600, is printed in Mr. Collier's preface
to Shakespeare's <i>Henry Fifth</i> (new edition).</p>

<p>The story of the tennis-balls is adopted from the chronicles by
Shakespeare. "It is reported by some historians," says Hume, "that the
Dauphin, in derision of Henry's claims and dissolute character, sent him
a box of tennis-balls, intimating that mere implements of play were
better adapted to him than the instruments of war. But this story is by
no means credible; the great offers made by the court of France show
that they had already entertained a just idea of Henry's character, as
well as of their own situation." <i>History of England</i>, ch. xix.</p>

<h3><a name="JANE_SHORE" id="JANE_SHORE"></a>JANE SHORE.</h3>


<p>The story and character of Jane Shore can best be read in a charmingly
written passage of Sir Thomas More's <i>History of Edward Fifth</i>, quoted
in Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, ii. 268. The ballad adheres to matter of fact
with a fidelity very uncommon. In Drayton's <i>England's Heroical
Epistles</i> is one from Jane Shore to King Edward, and in the notes he
thus gives her portrait: "Her stature was meane, her haire of a dark
yellow, her face round and full, her eye gray, delicate harmony being
betwixt each part's proportion, and each proportion's colour, her body
fat, white, and smooth, her countenance cheerfull and like to her
condition." (Cited by Percy.)</p>

<p>This ballad is taken from the Collection of 1723, vol. i. p. 145. The
full title is: <i>The Woeful Lamentation of Jane Shore, a Goldsmith's Wife
in London, sometime King Edward the Fourth's Concubine</i>. The same
version, with trifling variations, is found in Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, ii.
274, and Ritson's <i>Ancient Songs</i>, ii. 128. In the <i>Garland of Good
Will</i> there is another piece on the same subject, (Percy Society, vol.
xxx. p. 9, <i>The Lamentation of Shore's Wife</i>,) and in the Collection of
1723, a burlesque song, called <i>King Edward and Jane Shore</i> (vol. i. p.
153).</p>

<p class="center">From Evans's <i>Old Ballads</i>, iii. 132.</p>


<p>The favor shown by Queen Mary to her brother Lord James Stuart, on her
first coming to Scotland, excited a violent jealousy in Gordon, Earl of
Huntly, who, as a Catholic, and the head of a loyal and powerful family
in the North, expected no slight distinction from his sovereign. This
jealousy broke out into open hostility when the Queen, in 1562,
conferred on her brother the earldom of Murray, the honors and revenues
of which had been enjoyed by Huntly since 1548. Mary was at this time on
a progress in the northern part of her kingdom, attended by the new earl
and a small escort. Huntly collected his<!-- Page 211 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> vassals and posted himself at
a place called the Fair Bank, or Corichie, near Aberdeen. Murray having
increased his forces by seven or eight hundred of the Forbeses and
Leslies, who, although attached to the Huntly faction, dared not disobey
the Queen's summons, marched to the attack. As little confidence could
be placed in the good faith of the northern recruits, he ordered them to
begin the battle. In obedience to this command, they advanced against
the enemy, but instantly recoiled and retreated in a pretended panic on
Murray's reserve, followed by the Gordons in disorder. The Queen's party
received both the flying and the pursuers with an impenetrable front of
lances. Huntly was repulsed, and the other northern clans, seeing how
the victory was going, turned their swords upon their friends. Many of
the Gordons were slain, and the Earl, who was old and fat, being thrown
from his horse, was smothered in the retreat. His sons John and Adam
were taken prisoners, and the former was put to death at Aberdeen the
day after the battle.</p>

<p>The following ballad, it will be perceived, is utterly at variance with
the facts of history. It was first printed in Evans's <i>Old Ballads</i>, and
is said to be the composition of one Forbes, schoolmaster at
Mary-Culter, on Dee-side. The dialect is broad Aberdeen.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_BATTLE_OF_BALRINNES" id="THE_BATTLE_OF_BALRINNES"></a>THE BATTLE OF BALRINNES,</h3>

<h4>(OTHERWISE CALLED THE BATTLE OF GLENLIVET.)</h4>


<p>When Philip the Second was preparing his Armada for the conquest of
England, he spared no pains to induce James of Scotland to favor his
enterprise. Elizabeth, on her part, was not less active to secure the
friendship of a neighbor, who, by opening or closing his ports, might do
so much to assist or to counteract the projects of her enemy. James had
the<!-- Page 215 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> wisdom to see that it was not for his interest to ally himself with
a power that sought the extinction of the faith which he professed, and
the subjugation of a kingdom to which he was the heir. The Spanish
overtures were rejected, and the great body of the people, warmly
applauding the king's decision, entered into a combination to resist an
attempt to land at any point on the Scottish coast. There was,
nevertheless, a small party in Scotland which favoured the designs of
Philip. At the head of this faction were the Catholic Earls of Huntly,
Errol, and Angus. Even after the dispersion of the Armada, they kept up
negotiations with the Prince of Parma and the King of Spain, in the hope
of restoring the ancient religion, or at least of obtaining for
themselves an equality of privileges with the Protestants. More than
once were the leaders of this party committed to prison for overt acts
of treason, and released by the clemency of the sovereign, but suffering
as the Romanists did under the oppression of a fanatical majority,
rebellion was their natural condition.</p>

<p>After various acts of insubordination, continued for a series of years,
it was proved beyond question that the Catholic earls had signed papers
for an invasion of Britain by 30,000 foreigners. A Convention of
Estates, summoned to consider the affair, finally determined that the
three earls should be exempt from further inquiry on account of this
conspiracy, but that before the first day of February, 1594, they should
either renounce the errors of Popery, or remove from the kingdom. The
Catholic leaders, relying on the number of their supporters, and not
less on the inaccessible nature of the country in which their estates<!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
lay, scornfully rejected the choice proposed to them, renewed their
connections with Spain, and were accordingly declared guilty of high
treason and subjected to the doom of forfeiture.</p>

<p>King James's exchequer was at this time so low that it was impossible
for him to undertake the enforcing of this sentence in person. He was
obliged to delegate the office to the young Earl of Argyle, who was
induced to accept the appointment by the promise of a portion of
Huntly's forfeited estates. The prospect of booty and the authority of
the chief of the Campbells drew together six or seven thousand
Highlanders, to whom were joined some hundreds of men from the Western
Islands, under the chief of Maclean. With this body, one fourth of whom
carried firelocks, while the rest were armed after the Gaelic fashion,
Argyle descended from the hills towards Huntly's castle of Strathbogie.</p>

<p>The chief of the Gordons, suddenly assailed, had no time to procure
assistance from Angus. He collected about a thousand gentlemen of his
own name, and Errol came to his aid with two or three hundred of the
Hays. All these were men of birth, well armed and mounted, and to this
small, but powerful, troop of cavalry, was added a train of six field
pieces (engines very terrible to Highlanders), under the management of
an excellent soldier, the very same Captain Ker, who has figured already
in the ballad of <i>Edom o' Gordon</i>.</p>

<p>The armies encountered at a place called Belrinnes in a district called
Glenlivet. The Highlanders were posted on a mountain-side, so steep that
footmen could barely keep their hold. Notwithstanding this obstacle,<!-- Page 217 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
the Earls determined to attempt the ascent, and Errol, supported by Sir
Patrick Gordon, led the Hays up the hill in the very face of the foe.
While the vanguard was advancing, Ker brought some of his artillery to
bear on Argyle's front, which threw the Highlanders into confusion, and
caused some of them to fly. Errol's horsemen, however, were soon forced
by the steepness of the mountain to wheel and move obliquely, and their
flank being thus exposed, their horses suffered considerable damage from
a volley of bullets and arrows. Upon this Huntly made a fierce attack
upon Argyle's centre, and bore down his banner, and his cavalry soon
after attaining to more even ground, where their horses could operate
with efficiency, the Highlanders, who were destitute of lances, and so
unable to withstand the shock, were driven down the other side of the
hill, and put to utter rout. The chief of Maclean alone withstood the
assault of the horsemen, and performed marvellous feats of bravery, but
was at last forced off the field by his own soldiers, and Argyle himself
was compelled to fly, weeping with anger. Of the Catholics, Sir Patrick
Gordon, Huntley's uncle, was slain, with only twelve others. The loss of
the other party was several hundred soldiers, besides some men of note,
among them Campbell of Lochinzell.</p>

<p>This battle was fought on the third of October, 1594. The action is
called the Battle of Glenlivet, or of Balrinnes, and also of
Strath-aven.&mdash;See the 38th chapter of Sir W. Scott's <i>History of
Scotland</i>, and the contemporary narrative in Dalzell's <i>Scotish Poems of
the Sixteenth Century</i>, i. 136.</p>

<p>The ballad which follows is taken from the publica<!-- Page 218 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>tion of Dalzell just
mentioned, vol. ii. p. 347. There is a copy in the Pepys Collection, and
another in the Advocates' Library, printed at Edinburgh in 1681. The
ballad is also printed, undoubtedly from a stall copy, in <i>Scarce
Ancient Ballads</i>, p. 29. The first four stanzas had previously been
given in Jamieson's <i>Popular Ballads</i>, ii. 144. The older version of
Dalzell is somewhat defective, and abounds in errors, which, as well as
the vitiated orthography, are attributed to the ignorance of an English
transcriber. The omissions are here supplied in the margin from the
other copies.</p>

<p>This ballad is taken from Maidment's <i>North Countrie Garland</i>, p. 15.
There is another version in Buchan's <i>Ballads of the North of Scotland</i>,
ii. 136 (<i>The Death of John Seton</i>).</p>

<p>John Seton of Pitmedden, a young and brave cavalier, was shot through
the middle by a cannon ball, during the skirmish at the Bridge of Dee,
while engaged, under the Viscount of Aboyne, in resisting the advance of
Montrose upon the town of Aberdeen, in June, 1639. It was the hard fate
of Aberdeen to suffer from the arms of Montrose, first, when he was
general of the Covenanters, and again while he was<!-- Page 231 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> lieutenant for the
King. The murder and pillage perpetrated in the town by the Irish after
the defeat of Lord Burleigh, in 1644, have been made the subject of
violent reproach by his enemies, but it may perhaps be said, that for
all that exceeded the usual horrors of war, the heroic commander was not
responsible. In Buchan's version of the present ballad, the clemency
shown by Montrose on taking possession of the city in 1639 is
commemorated in three stanzas worthy of preservation. The Covenanters
were "resolved to have sacked it orderly."</p>

<p class="center">Ritson's <i>Scottish Songs</i>, ii. 40. Johnson's <i>Museum</i>, p. 502.</p>


<p>This ballad, very popular in Scotland, was long sold on the stalls
before it was received into the collections. A glance will show that it
has at best been very imperfectly transmitted by oral tradition. In
fact, the Ettrick Shepherd seems to be right in maintaining that two
widely separated events are here jumbled together. The first five
stanzas apparently refer to an action in May, 1690, when Sir Thomas
Livingston surprised fifteen hundred Highlanders in their beds at
Cromdale, and the remainder to the lost battle of Auldern, where
Montrose, with far inferior forces, defeated Sir John Hurry with
prodigious slaughter, on the 4th of May, 1645. Mr. Stenhouse<!-- Page 235 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> states,
indeed, that after that imprudent division of the army of the Covenant
which opened the way to the disaster at Auldern, Hurry surprised and
routed at Cromdale a body of Highlanders under the lion-hearted Allaster
Macdonald. But this check appears, by his own language, to have been too
slight an affair to call forth such verses as those with which the
ballad begins. See Hogg's <i>Jacobite Relics</i>, ii. 157, Johnson's <i>Museum</i>
(1853), iv. 428.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_BATTLE_OF_ALFORD" id="THE_BATTLE_OF_ALFORD"></a>THE BATTLE OF ALFORD.</h3>


<p>Two months after the defeat of Sir John Hurry at Auldern, Montrose
utterly destroyed the other division of the covenanting army, under
General Baillie, at Alford on the Don. On the 2d of July, the King's
forces marched from Drumminor, and crossed the Don to Alford, Montrose
and the Earl of Aboyne taking up their quarters in the castle of Asloun.
Baillie, who was now in pursuit of the royalists, moved southward, and
encamped on the day just mentioned, at Lesly. The next morning he
crossed the river (halting on the way near a farm called Mill Hill),
whereupon the battle took place. Montrose dearly purchased this new
victory by the loss of Lord George Gordon, who commanded the <i>right</i>
wing, not the left.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>, ii. 203</p>


<p>"The insurrection commemorated and magnified in the following ballad, as
indeed it has been in some histories, was, in itself, no very important
affair. It began in Dumfries-shire, where Sir James Turner, a soldier of
fortune, was employed to levy the arbitrary fines imposed for not
attending the Episcopal churches. The people rose, seized his person,
disarmed his soldiers, and, having continued together, resolved to march
towards Edinburgh, expecting to be joined by their friends in that
quarter. In this they were disappointed; and, being now diminished to
half their numbers, they drew up on the Pentland Hills, at a place
called Rullien Green. They were commanded by one Wallace; and here they
awaited the approach of General Dalziel, of Binns; who, having marched
to Calder, to meet them on the Lanark road, and finding, that, by
passing through Collington, they had got to the other side of the hills,
cut through the mountains and approached them. Wallace showed both
spirit and judgment: he drew up his men in a very strong situation, and
withstood two charges of Dalziel's cavalry; but, upon the third shock,
the insurgents were broken and utterly dispersed. There was very little
slaughter, as the cavalry of Dalziel were chiefly gentlemen, who pitied
their oppressed and misguided countrymen. There were about fifty killed,
and as many made prisoners. The battle was<!-- Page 241 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> fought on the 28th November,
1666; a day still observed by the scattered remnant of the Cameronian
sect, who regularly hear a field-preaching upon the field of battle.</p>

<p>"I am obliged for a copy of the ballad to Mr. Livingston of Airds, who
took it down from the recitation of an old woman residing on his estate.</p>

<p>Several companies, principally Irish, belonging to the army of King
James, and stationed at Reading, had quitted the town in consequence of
a report that the Prince of Orange was advancing in that direction with
the main body of his forces. On the departure of the garrison, the
people of Reading at once invited the Prince to take possession of the
place, and secure them against the Irish. But the King's troops, having
learned that it was only a small detachment of William's soldiers, and
not the main army, by whom they were threatened, returned and reoccupied
their post. Here they were attacked by two hundred and fifty of the
Dutch, and though numbering six hundred, were soon put to flight, with
the loss of their colors and of fifty men, the assailants losing but
five. This skirmish occurred on Sunday, the 9th of December, 1688.</p>

<p>This piece is extracted from Croker's <i>Historical Songs of Ireland</i>, p.
14, Percy Society, vol. i., and was there given from a collection of
printed ballads in the British Museum. The burden seems to be derived
from the following stanza of <i>Lilli burlero</i>:</p>

<h3><a name="UNDAUNTED_LONDONDERRY" id="UNDAUNTED_LONDONDERRY"></a>UNDAUNTED LONDONDERRY.</h3>


<p>The story of the siege of Londonderry, "the most memorable in the annals
of the British isles," is eloquently told in the twelfth chapter of
Macaulay's <i>History of England</i>. It lasted one hundred and five days,
from the middle of April to the first of August (1689). During that time
the garrison had been reduced from about seven thousand men to about
three thousand. Famine and pestilence slew more than the fire of the
enemy. In the last month of the siege, there was scarcely any thing left
to eat in the city but salted hides and tallow. The price of a dog's paw
was five shillings and sixpence, and rats that had<!-- Page 248 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> fed on the bodies of
the dead were eagerly hunted and slain. The courage and self-devotion of
the defenders, animated by a lofty public spirit and sustained by
religious zeal, were at last rewarded by a glorious triumph, and will
never cease to be celebrated with pride and enthusiasm by the
Protestants of Ireland.</p>

<p>The ballad is here given as printed in Croker's <i>Historical Songs of
Ireland</i>, p. 46, from a black letter copy in the British Museum. The
whole title runs thus: <i>Undaunted Londonderry; or, the Victorious
Protestants' constant success against the proud French and Irish
Forces</i>. <i>To the Tune of Lilli Borlero.</i></p>

<h3><a name="THE_BOYNE_WATER" id="THE_BOYNE_WATER"></a>THE BOYNE WATER.</h3>


<p>This momentous battle was fought on the 1st of July, 1690. James had a
strong position and thirty thousand men, two thirds of whom were a
worthless rabble. William had thirty-six thousand splendid soldiers. The
loss on neither side was great. Of James's troops there fell fifteen
hundred, the flower of his army; of the conqueror's not more than five,
but with them the great Duke of Schomberg. The present version of this
ballad is from Croker's <i>Historical Songs of Ireland</i>, p. 60, given from
a MS. copy in the editor's possession.</p>

<p>Cork was taken September 27-29, 1690, by the Duke (then Earl) of
Marlborough, with the coöperation of the Duke of Wirtemberg. The Duke of
Grafton, then serving as a volunteer, was mortally wounded while
advancing to the assault. Croker suggests that this lamentation for the

Lowlanders, not understanding, have corrupted. There is another copy in
Hogg's <i>Jacobite Relics</i>, ii. 18, which is nearly the same as the
following.</p>

<p>When the Earl of Mar first raised his standard, and proclaimed the
Chevalier, the ornamental ball on the top of the staff fell off, and the
superstitious High<!-- Page 265 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>landers interpreted the circumstance as ominous of
ill for their cause. This is the incident referred to in the third
stanza.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_MARQUIS_OF_HUNTLEYS_RETREAT_FROM_THE_BATTLE_OF_SHERIFFMUIR" id="THE_MARQUIS_OF_HUNTLEYS_RETREAT_FROM_THE_BATTLE_OF_SHERIFFMUIR"></a>THE MARQUIS OF HUNTLEY'S RETREAT FROM THE BATTLE OF SHERIFFMUIR.</h3>

<p class="center">See <a href="#Page_156">p. 156</a>. From <i>A New Book of Old Ballads</i>, p. 30.</p>


<p>Hogg inserted this ballad in the <i>Jacobite Relics</i>, ii. 13, using, says
Maidment, the editor of the publication cited above, a very imperfect
manuscript copy. The following version was taken from the original
broad-side, supposed to be unique. There are very considerable
variations in the language of the two copies, and the order of the
stanzas is quite different. This says Hogg, "is exclusively a party
song, made by some of the Grants, or their adherents, in obloquy of
their more potent neighbours, the Gordons. It is in a great measure
untrue; for, though the Marquis of Huntley was on the left wing at the
head of a body of horse, and among the gentlemen that fled, yet two
battalions of Gordons, or at least of Gordon's vassals, perhaps mostly
of the Clan Chattan, behaved themselves as well as any on the field, and
were particularly instrumental in breaking the Whig cavalry, or the left
wing of their army, and driving them back among their foot. On this
account, as well as that of the bitter personalities that it contains,
the "song is only curious as an inveterate party song, and not as a
genuine humorous description of the fight that the Marquis and his
friends were in. The latter part of<!-- Page 268 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> the [third] stanza seems to allude
to an engagement that took place at Dollar, on the 24th October, a
fortnight previous to the battle of Sheriffmuir. Mar had despatched a
small body of cavalry to force an assessment from the town of
Dunfermline, of which Argyle getting notice, sent out a stronger party,
who surprised them early in the morning before daylight, and arrested
them, killing some and taking seventeen prisoners, several of whom were
Gordons. The last stanza [but one] evidently alludes to the final
submission of the Marquis and the rest of the Gordons to King George's
government, which they did to the Grants and the Earl of Sutherland. The
former had previously taken possession of Castle Gordon; of course, the
malicious bard of the Grants, with his ill-scraped pen, was not to let
that instance of the humiliation of his illustrious neighbours pass
unnoticed.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jacobite Relics</span>, vol. ii. p. 255.</p>

<h3><a name="KING_LEIR_AND_HIS_THREE_DAUGHTERS" id="KING_LEIR_AND_HIS_THREE_DAUGHTERS"></a>KING LEIR AND HIS THREE DAUGHTERS.</h3>


<p>From <i>A Collection of Old Ballads</i>, ii. 8. The same, with one or two
trifling verbal differences, in Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, i. 246.</p>

<p>This story was originally told by Geoffrey of Monmouth, <i>Historia
Britonum</i>, lib. ii. c. 2. It occurs in two forms in the <i>Gesta
Romanorum</i>: see Madden's <i>Old English Versions</i>, p. 44, p. 450.</p>

<p>Shakespeare's <i>King Lear</i> was first printed in 1608, and is supposed to
have been written between 1603 and 1605. Another drama on the subject
was printed in 1605, called <i>The true Chronicle History of King Leir and
his Three Daughters, Gonorill, Ragan, and Cordella</i>. This was probably
only a new impression of a piece entered in the Stationers' Registers as
early as 1594. The ballad which follows agrees with Shakespeare's play
in several particulars in which Shakespeare varies from the older drama
and from Holinshed, the authority of both dramas. The name Cordelia is
also found in place of the Cordella of the <i>Chronicle History</i>; but, on
the other hand, we have Ragan instead of Shakespeare's Regan. In the
absence of a date, we are unable to determine whether the ballad was
written prior to the play of <i>King Lear</i>, or was founded upon it.</p>

<h3><a name="FAIR_ROSAMOND" id="FAIR_ROSAMOND"></a>FAIR ROSAMOND.</h3>


<p>The celebrated mistress of Henry the Second was daughter to Walter
Clifford, a baron of Herefordshire. She bore the king two sons, one of
them while he was still Duke of Normandy. Before her death she retired
to the convent of Godstow, and there she was buried; but Hugh, Bishop of
Lincoln, not courtly enough to distinguish between royal and vulgar
immoralities, caused her body to be removed, and interred in the common
cemetery, "lest Christian religion should grow in contempt."</p>

<p>The story of Queen Eleanor's poisoning her rival is not confirmed by the
old writers, though they mention the labyrinth. All the romance in
Rosamond's history appears to be the offspring of popular fancy. Percy
has collected the principal passages from the chronicles in his preface
to the ballad.</p>

<p><i>Fair Rosamond</i> is the work of Thomas Deloney, a well-known ballad-maker
who died about 1600. Our copy is the earliest that is known, and is
taken from Deloney's <i>Strange Histories</i>, ed. of 1607, as reprinted by
the Percy Society, vol. iii. p. 54. The same is found in the <i>Crown
Garland of Golden Roses</i>, ed. 1659 (Per. Soc. vol. vi. p. 12), and in
the <i>Garland of Good Will</i>, ed. 1678 (Per. Soc. vol. xxx. p. 1.):<!-- Page 284 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> and
besides, with trifling variations, in <i>A Collection of Old Ballads</i>, i.
11, Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, ii. 151, and Ritson's <i>Ancient Songs</i>, ii. 120,
from black-letter copies.</p>

<p>Another ballad with the title of the <i>Unfortunate Concubine, or,
Rosamond's Overthrow</i>, is given in the collection of 1723, vol. i. p. 1.
The story is also treated in the forty-first chapter of Warner's
<i>Albion's England</i>. Warner has at least one good stanza,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which is
more than can be said of this wretched, but very popular, production.</p>

<p>Some corrections have been adopted from the <i>Crown Garland of Golden
Roses</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="QUEEN_ELEANORS_FALL" id="QUEEN_ELEANORS_FALL"></a>QUEEN ELEANOR'S FALL.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>A Collection of Old Ballads</i>, i. 97.</p>


<p>"I never was more surprised," says the editor of the Collection of 1723,
"than at the sight of the following ballad; little expecting to see
pride and wickedness laid to the charge of the most affable and most
virtuous of women: whose glorious actions are not recorded by <i>our</i>
historians only; for no foreign writers, who have touched upon those
early times, have in silence passed over this illustrious princess, and
every nation rings with the praise of Eleonora Isabella of Castile, King
Edward's Queen. Father Le Monie, who (in his <i>Gallérie des Femmes
Fortes</i>) has searched all Christendom round, from its very infancy to
the last age, for five heroines, very partially bestows the first place
upon one of his own country-women, but gives the second, with a far
superior character, to this queen."</p>

<p>In this absurdly false and ignorant production, the well-beloved
Eleonora of Castile is no doubt con<!-- Page 292 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>founded with her most unpopular
mother-in-law, Eleanor of Provence, the wife of Henry the Third, whose
luxurious habits, and quarrels with the city of London, might afford
some shadow of a basis for the impossible slanders of the ballad-singer.
Queenhithe was a quay, the tolls of which formed part of the revenue of
the Queen, and Eleanor of Provence rendered herself extremely odious by
compelling vessels, for the sake of her fees, to unlade there.
Charing-cross was one of thirteen monuments raised by Edward the First
at the stages, where his queen's body rested, on its progress from the
place of her decease to Westminster. In the connection of both these
places with the name of a Queen Eleanor may be found (as Miss Strickland
suggests in her <i>Lives of the Queens</i>) the germ of the marvellous story
of the disappearance at Charing-cross and the resurrection at
Queenhithe.</p>

<p>That portion of the story which relates to the cruelty exercised by the
queen towards the Lord Mayor's wife is borrowed from the <i>Gesta
Romanorum</i>. See Madden's <i>Old English Versions</i>, &amp;c. p. 226, <i>Olimpus
the Emperour</i>. Peele's <i>Chronicle History of Edward the First</i> exhibits
the same misrepresentations of Eleanor of Castile. See what is said of
this play in connection with the ballad of <i>Queen Eleanor's Confession</i>,
vol. vi. p. 209. The whole title of the ballad is:&mdash;</p>

<p>From <i>Strange Histories</i>, p. 17 (Percy Society, vol. iii). Other copies,
with variations, are in <i>The Crown-Garland of Golden Roses</i>, Part II. p.
20 (Percy Society, vol. xv.), and <i>A Collection of Old Ballads</i>, iii.
91. The editor of <i>Strange Histories</i> informs us that a play on the same
subject as the ballad was written by Thomas Drew, or Drue, early in the
reign of James I., and printed in 1631, under the title of <i>The Duchess
of Suffolk, her Life</i>. He remarks further that both play and ballad was
founded upon the nar<!-- Page 299 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>rative of Fox, anno 1558 [<i>Acts and Monuments</i>,
iii. 926, ed. 1641]; but the differences between Fox's account and the
story which follows are altogether too great for this supposition to be
true.</p>

<p>Katharine, daughter of Lord Willoughby of Eresby, was first married to
Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, and after his death to Richard Bertie,
Esq., with whom she was forced to fly from persecution in 1553, taking
refuge first in the Low Countries, and afterwards in Poland.</p>

TIME OF QUEENE ELIZABETH, WHO ENDED HIS DAYES IN A BATTAILE OF KINGS IN
BARBARIE.</h3>


<p>Thomas Stuckley, says Fuller, "was a younger brother, of an ancient,
wealthy, and worshipful family, nigh Ilfracombe in this county [Devon],
being one of good parts; but valued the less by others, because
overprized by himself. Having prodigally mis-spent his patrimony, he
entered on several projects (the issue general of all decayed estates);
and first pitched on the peopling of Florida, then newly found out, in
the West Indies. So confident his ambition, that he blushed not to tell
Queen Elizabeth, 'that he preferred rather to be sovereign of a
mole-hill, than the highest subject to the greatest king in
Christendom;' adding, moreover, 'that he was assured he should be a
prince before his death.' 'I hope,' said Queen Elizabeth, 'I shall hear
from you, when you are stated in your principality.' 'I will write unto
you,' quoth Stuckley. 'In what language?' said the Queen. He returned,
'In the style of princes: To our dear sister.'</p>

<p>"His fair project of Florida being blasted for lack of money to pursue
it, he went over into Ireland, where he was frustrated of the preferment
he expected, and met such physic that turned his fever into frenzy; for
hereafter resolving treacherously to<!-- Page 306 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> attempt what he could not loyally
achieve, he went over into Italy.</p>

<p>"It is incredible how quickly he wrought himself through the notice into
the favour, through the court into the chamber, yea closet, yea bosom of
Pope Pius Quintus; so that some wise men thought his Holiness did
forfeit a parcel of his infallibility in giving credit to such a
<i>glorioso</i>, vaunting that with three thousand soldiers he would beat all
the English out of Ireland.</p>

<p>"The Pope finding it cheaper to fill Stuckley's swelling sails with airy
titles than real gifts, created him Baron of Ross, Viscount Murrough,
Earl of Wexford, Marquis of Leinster; and then furnished this
title-top-heavy general with eight hundred soldiers, paid by the King of
Spain, for the Irish expedition.</p>

<p>"In passage thereunto, Stuckley lands at Portugal, just when Sebastian,
the king thereof, with two Moorish kings, were undertaking a voyage into
Africa. Stuckley, scorning to attend, is persuaded to accompany them.
Some thought he wholly quitted his Irish design, partly because loath to
be pent up in an island (the continent of Africa affording more
elbow-room for his achievements); partly because so mutable his mind, he
ever loved the last project (as mothers the youngest child) best. Others
conceive he took this African in order to his Irish design; such his
confidence of conquest, that his breakfast on the Turks would the better
enable him to dine on the English in Ireland.</p>

<p>"Landing in Africa, Stuckley gave council which was safe, seasonable,
and necessary; namely, that for two or three days they should refresh
their land soldiers; whereof some were sick, and some were weak,<!-- Page 307 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span> by
reason of their tempestuous passage. This would not be heard; so furious
was Don Sebastian to engage; as if he would pluck up the bays of victory
out of the ground, before they were grown up; and so, in the battle of
Alcaser, their army was wholly defeated: where Stuckley lost his life.</p>

<span class="i0">'A fatal fight, where in one day was slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three kings that were, and one that would be fain!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"This battle was fought anno 1578, where Stuckley, with his eight
hundred men, behaved himself most valiantly, till overpowered with
multitude." <i>Worthies of England</i>, by Nuttall, i. 414.</p>

<p>Mr. Dyce, in his prefatory note to Peele's <i>Battle of Alcazar</i>, having
cited the above extract with several poetical notices of Stukeley,
mentions another play founded on this adventurer's exploits (<i>The Famous
Historye of the Life and Death of Captaine Thomas Stukely</i>), acted in
1596, and printed in 1605 (Peele's <i>Works</i>, ii. 85).</p>

<p>The ballad is from <i>The Crown-Garland of Golden Roses</i> (Percy Society,
vol. vi.) p. 33. There are some verses on Stukeley's projected voyage to
Florida in Mr. Collier's <i>Old Ballads</i>, in the first volume of the Percy
Society, p. 73.</p>

<h3><a name="LORD_DELAWARE" id="LORD_DELAWARE"></a>LORD DELAWARE.</h3>


<p>No plausible foundation for this ballad has as yet been found in
history. It has been suggested that Delaware is a corruption of De la
Mare, a speaker of the House of Commons, and a great advocate of popular
rights, in the reign of Edward the Third! But there is no accounting for
the Dutch lord and the Welsh Duke of Devonshire on this or any other
supposition.</p>

<p>The ballad is given from Lyle's <i>Ancient Ballads and Songs</i>, p. 135, as
"noted down from the singing of a gentleman," and then "remodelled and
smoothed down" by the editor. The same copy is printed in Dixon's
<i>Ancient Poems, Ballads and Songs</i> (Percy Society, vol. xvii.), p. 80,
and in Bell's volume with the same title, p. 66.</p>
